![alt text](https://github.com/Dom-888/First-Milestone-Project/blob/master/assets/images/fire.jpg "Band snapshot")


In this project I have created a website for the cover band The Steve ‘n’ Seagulls, the purpose of the site is to provide fans and potential fans with an easy access to the music produced by the band, as well as key information such as news and tour dates, and finally the possibility to book concerts and buying merchandise, all in one place.
The goal is to keep users coming back for more.

The key demographic for this project are fans of The Steve ‘n’ Seagulls who wish to listen to their favorite tracks on, see any news related to the band, book concerts or buy merchandise. They will also be able to link to The Steve ‘n’ Seagulls Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages from this website.

A secondary audience are music lovers who have recently heard about the band and want to know more, considering the particular style of the band that combines rock with bluegrass music, fans of both genres are potential fans of The Steve ‘n’ Seagulls. The site offers a selection of the best pieces produced by the band, as well as a gallery to give a better idea of who the band is

#### Surface

##### Color Palette

For this project I choosed rustics, autumn-like colors, that I think may fit well the style of the band

- Dark Brown (#380202): Used for navbar and footer
- Autumn Red (#9A0501): Mostly used to highlight the most important parts of text such: Title, Names of Band Members and Section Headers
- Ultra Light Gray (#f7f7f7): The site uses an alternation of fixed pictures and light gray as backgrounds for the sections
- Night Blue (#222D5A): Used exclusively for the buttons: "Book now" and "Send". I choosed this color to attract the user's attention without clashing too much with the rest of the palette

##### Hover effects

To make navigating the site more pleasant, some hover effects have been added to the following elements:

- Navbar: Hovering on the navbar elements produces a sweep-to-bottom effect that highlights the selected element
- Footer: Hovering on the social media icons of the footer highlight them with the proper social media color
- Buttons: I used the bootsrap buttons but I overwrote the default hover effect with a simple underline, in order to remain consistent with the color palette

## Features

#### Interface

- Mobile first approach: The site is conceived starting from the smaller screens. Where necessary media queries were then used to adapt or change the content to larger screens

- Semantic HTML: Semantic tags have been used where appropriate

#### Functionality

- Navbar: The site consists of a single scrolling page divided into sections, each of which is accessible at any time thanks to the fixed navbar on top. By default it is compressed into a burger button but expands as soon as there is sufficient space for all its elements.

- Return-to-top button
Note that the navbar lack the Home button, its function is performed by the Return-to-the-top button.
Since this website is composed of a single scrolling page, the home page corresponds to the top of the page. For this reason instead of the classic upward arrow I used the home icon

#### Features Left to Implement

- Embedded Facebook responsivity must be improved for very small screen (less than 360px width)

- The "sent" button in the contact form should be made functional

- The CSS scroll-behavior Property was used to smoothly animate the scroll position. This rule is not supported by Internet Explorer, Edge or Safari. JavaScript should be used instead

## Technologies Used

- HTML5

- CSS3

- JavaScript

- Bootstrap 4

- FontAwesome

- Google Fonts

- Font Awesome

- Iframely (https://iframely.com/) was used to make embedded tweets responsive (I have been authorized to use iframely for free as this project has no commercial purposes)

- Hover.css (http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) was used to create the sweep-to-the-bottom effect in the navbar

- Paint.net (https://www.getpaint.net/) was used for simple image manipulation

## Testing

Throughout the development of the project I made extensive use of Chrome DevTools to test the site

## Deployment

This website was developed on Gitdod and deployed on GitHub from the master branch, it can be accessed from the following url: https://dom-888.github.io/First-Milestone-Project/

## Final Note

As with many bands, the members have changed over time. This site is about the original founders of the band (2012-2017), not the current ones
